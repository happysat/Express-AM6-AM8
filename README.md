Its content broadcasting includes a number of controversial <a href="https://rumble.com/v241fl2-play-with-sat-stuff.html">Russian</a>, Syrian and Iranian (news) channels.<br>
Which are banned from broadcasting by EU distributors/providers due sanctions against Russia (everything) and Iran (Press TV).<br>

## Satellite Description

Operated and owned by RSCC (Russian Satellite Communications Company) Express AM6 and AM8 from an orbital slot at 14° Degrees West and 53° Degrees East.<br>

Express AM6 and AM8 are providing fixed and mobile communication services.<br>

As well as broadcast services for digital television and radio, data transmission,
high-speed Internet access and secure government communications.<br>

<img src="/img/АМ8.jpg" alt="" width="304" height="178"> <img src="/img/Express_AM6.jpeg" alt="" width="304" height="178">

<a href="https://orbit.ing-now.com/satellite/40277/2014-064a/express-am6/">Express-AM6</a> (Norad:40277 2014-064A) was launched by a Proton M launcher from Baikonur Cosmodrome into orbit on October 21, 2014.<br>
The Briz-M upper stage shut down too early in the fourth burn and left the satellite in a lower than planned orbit.<br> 
The satellite reached the operational geostationary orbit by using its own SPT-100 Stationary Plasma Thrusters.<br>

MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. (MDA), constructed the Express AM6 payload, and ISS Reshetnev constructed the satellite bus which was based on the Express-2000 platform.<br>
The satellite has a mass of 3,400 kg (7,403 lb), provides 14 kilowatts to its payload, and a planned operational lifespan of 15 years.<br>

<a href="https://orbit.ing-now.com/satellite/40895/2015-048a/express-am8/">Express-AM8</a> (Norad:40895 2015-048A) was launched by a Proton M launcher from Baikonur Cosmodrome into orbit on September 14, 2015.<br>

Thales Alenia Space, constructed the Express AM8 payload, and ISS Reshetnev constructed the satellite bus which was based on the Express-1000NTB platform.<br>
The satellite has a mass of 2,100 kg (4,600 lb), provides 5.9 kilowatts to its payload, and a planned operational lifespan of 15 years.<br>

It should be taken into account that Express AM6 and AM8 are no ordinary DTH high power satellites like Astra and Hotbird!<br>

Express AM6 and AM8 are subject to frequent frequency and signal strength changes.<br>
Transponder with low symbolrates are used, and many test's are performed varying from DVB-S(2) to T2-MI.<br>

Transponders/Channels details and info can change on a daily base.<br>
Which makes this a interesting exotic "DX" satellite with trans-atlantic coverage and custom cross-strap footprint configurations.<br>

The satellite transponders are also regularly hacked or disrupted by jamming signals.<br>
This is no unique case and it did happen at Eutelsat Hotbird Position (and a number of other satellites) also.<br>

## Dish and LNB

For reception of Express AM6 and AM8 you need a dish in size >75 - 85 cm.<br>
A size between 80 - 1.20 cm is recommended.<br>

Dishes In use on my setup are:<br>
          <br>
          <img src="img/Triax.jpg" alt="" width="267" height="200">
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <img
            src="img/53_dish.jpg" alt="350" width="" height="200"><br>

2 x 89CM Triax Dish on 14 West and 53 degrees East.
          
Any Ku-band Satellite TV (DRO/PLL-based) LNB can be used for Express AM6 and AM8.<br>
I have various results with DRO and PLL based ones but shows clearly a huge increase of frequency stability YMMV.<br>

Regular Ku-band Satellite TV LNB (DRO) suffer from drift in frequency making it more difficult to keep a stable reception for the low symbolrate signals.<br>
Because of outside conditions (temperature changes, sun, clouds, wind ect).<br>

In use on my setup are:<br>

<img src="img/ultra.jpg" alt="" width="161" height="94"><br>

Invertro Ultra Black LNB (DRO Old model with longer neck).<br>

<img src="img/twin.jpg" alt="" width="185" height="185"><br>

Inverto Twin (PLL) LNB.<br>

## Footprint

Express AM6 carries 44 Ku-band, 14 C-band, 12 Ka-band and 2 L-band transponders with four footprints.

Two fixed and two steerable Ku-Band beams are served by 44 active Ku-Band transponders.<br> 
The fixed Ku-Zones include a Russian Beam that covers the western half of the country and portions of eastern Europe.<br>

While the second Ku-Zone stretches from the Middle East all the way across Central Europe into the northern countries.<br>
Mobile Ku-Beams can be used to provide communications coverage to regions of high demand.<br>

The first C-Band fixed zone covers a large portion of Russia.<br> 
Second C-Band beam covers the entire continent of Africa, Saudi Arabia and western and central Europe.<br>
Global C-Band beam provides coverage of the entire continent of Europe and Africa also covering portions of Asia and Australia.<br>

<img src="img/express-am6-footprint.jpg" alt="" width="567" height="405">

In March 2020 the five-year-old satellite's Ka-band payload was shut off due to a thermal control system malfunction with the spacecraft.<br>
<br>
Express AM8 carries 12 Ku-band transponders Linear 12x36 MHz; 4x54 MHz (150W) with three footprints:<br>
<br>
<img src="img/express-am8-ku-band-fix1.jpg" alt="" width="567" height="405">

Europe/Middle-East Fixed 1.<br>

<img src="img/express-am8-ku-band-fix2.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="533">

Africa/Middle-East Fixed 2.<br>
And Latin America/East coast of North America Fixed 3.<br>

24 C-band transponders Circular 24x40 MHz (100W) with coverage of two footprints:

Europe, Africa and the Middle-East and Latin America and the East coast of North America.<br>
And the payload has two L-band transponders.<br>

## T2-MI Technology

T2-MI (T2 Modulator Interface) is a method of encapsulating a satellite signal into an MPEG TS transport stream.<br>
In simple terms, using the T2Mi interface, channel packages in the DVB-T2 standard are transmitted from the satellite to base
earth stations for further distribution to T2 towers, <br>
which then transmit terrestrial digital television for TVs or DVB-T2 receivers.<br>&nbsp;<br>
That is, the channel packages in T2MI were not originally intended to be received by domestic satellite receivers. <br>
But with the development of processors for satellite receivers capable of processing them, it became possible to receive these TV channels at home on a regular home satellite receiver.<br>

Express AM8 did have a few T2-MI transponders.<br>

<img src="img/T2-MI.jpg" alt="" width="508" height="306"><br>

Broadcasting channels to DVB-T2 Multiplexes in Ukraine.

Update T2-MI Multistreams with the Russian package appear to have completely migrated to the Express AM6 53° East!<br>

## Satellite Receivers

Well, there is plenty of choice in this area, it depends a bit on what you want to see.<br>

<img src="img/1-0-1-1-14-1-D842-D76-0-0-0.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360"><br>

A lot is already possible to see with a normal HD receiver and it does not have to be new state of the art.<br>
Ci, softcam's or smart cards are not necessary because everything is broadcasting Free To Air.<br>

Off course for the T2-MI Multiplexes to show or even more, one need a new generation receiver or even better a <a href="https://www.tbsdtv.com/">TBS DVB-S Card</a> is recommended.<br>

<a href="https://www.tbsdtv.com/products" target="_blank"><img src="img/tbs5530_1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="300" border="0"></a>

Capable of receiving digital TV channels of multiple standards: DVB-S2X/S2/S/DVB-T2/C2/T/C(J.83 A/B/C)/ISDB-T/C/ATSC1.0<br> 
Also supporting CCM, VCM and Multi Input Streams.<br>

Advantages are analyzing streams, faster blindscanning, wide software choice (viewers/headends), multipule platform support Linux/Windwows/ARM, media features Kodi, adding second tuners in engima2 based recievers.<br>

Receivers in use on my setup are:<br>
