## Satellite Description

Operated and owned by RSCC (Russian Satellite Communications Company) from an orbital slot at 14° Degrees West.<br>
<a href="https://www.n2yo.com/satellite/?s=40895#results">Express-AM8</a> will provide high quality fixed and mobile communication services.<br>

As well as broadcast services for digital television and radio, data transmission,
high-speed Internet access and secure government communications.<br>

<img src="/img/АМ8.jpg" alt="" width="304" height="178">

<a href="https://orbit.ing-now.com/satellite/40895/2015-048a/express-am8/">Express-AM8</a> (Norad:40895 2015-048A) was launched by a Proton M launcher into orbit on September 14, 2015.<br>
Thales Alenia Space, constructed Express-AM8 payload, and ISS Reshetnev constructed the satellite bus which was based on the Ekspress-1000NTB platform.<br>
The satellite has a mass of 2,100 kg (4,600 lb), provides 5.9 kilowatts to its payload, and a planned operational lifespan of 15 years.<br>

It should be taken into account that Express AM8 is not an ordinary DTH high power satellite like Astra and Hotbird!<br>

Express AM8 is subject to frequent frequency and signal strength changes.<br>
Transponder with low symbolrates are used, and many test's are performed varying from DVB-S(2) to T2-MI.<br>

Transponders/Channels details and info can change on a daily base.<br>
Which makes this a interesting exotic "DX" satellite with trans-atlantic coverage and custom cross-strap footprint configurations.<br>

The satellite transponders are also regularly hacked or disrupted by jamming signals.<br>
This is no unique case and it did happen at Eutelsat Hotbird Position (and a number of other satellites) also.<br>

## Dish and LNB

For reception of Express-AM8 you need a dish in size >75 - 85 cm.<br>
A size between 80 - 1.20 cm is recommended.<br>

Dishes In use on my setup are:<br>
          <br>
          <img src="img/Triax.jpg" alt="" width="267" height="187">
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <img
            src="img/90cm.jpg" alt="" width="173" height="196"><br>

89CM Triax And 90CM Noname Dish.
          
Any Ku-band Satellite TV (DRO/PLL-based) LNB can be used for Express AM8.<br>
I have various results with DRO and PLL based ones but shows clearly a huge increase of frequency stability YMMV.<br>

Regular Ku-band Satellite TV LNB (DRO) suffer from drift in frequency making it more difficult to keep a stable reception for the low symbolrate signals.<br>
Because of outside conditions (temperature changes, sun, clouds, wind ect).<br>

In use on my setup are:<br>

<img src="img/ultra.jpg" alt="" width="161" height="94"><br>

Invertro Ultra Black LNB (DRO Old model with longer neck).<br>

<img src="img/twin.jpg" alt="" width="185" height="185"><br>

Inverto Twin (PLL) LNB.<br>

## Footprint

Express AM8 carries 12 Ku-band transponders with three footprints:

<img src="img/express-am8-ku-band-fix1.jpg" alt="" width="567" height="405">

Europe/Middle-East Fixed 1

<img src="img/express-am8-ku-band-fix2.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="533">

Africa/Middle-East Fixed 2.<br>
And Latin America/East coast of North America Fixed 3.<br>

24 C-band transponders with coverage of two footprints:

Europe, Africa and the Middle-East and Latin America and the East coast of North America.<br>
And the payload has two L-band transponders.<br>

## Dish align to Express-AM8

There are several ways to find Express-AM8 in the sky:

## T2-MI Technology

T2-MI (T2 Modulator Interface) is a method of encapsulating a satellite signal into an MPEG TS transport stream.<br>
In simple terms, using the T2Mi interface, channel packages in the DVB-T2 standard are transmitted from the satellite to base
earth stations for further distribution to T2 towers, <br>
which then transmit terrestrial digital television for TVs or DVB-T2 receivers.<br>&nbsp;<br>
That is, the channel packages in T2MI were not originally intended to be received by domestic satellite receivers. <br>
But with the development of processors for satellite receivers capable of processing them, it became possible to receive these TV channels at home on a regular home satellite receiver.<br>

Update T2-MI Multistreams with the Russian package appear to have completely migrated to the Express AM6 53° East!<br>

Express AM8 did have a few T2-MI transponders.<br>

<img src="img/T2-MI.jpg" alt="" width="508" height="306"><br>

Broadcasting channels to DVB-T2 Multiplexes in Ukraine.


## Satellite Receivers

Well, there is plenty of choice in this area, it depends a bit on what you want to see.<br>

<img src="img/1-0-1-1-14-1-D842-D76-0-0-0.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360"><br>

A lot is already possible to see with a normal HD receiver and it does not have to be new state of the art.<br>
Off course for the T2-MI Multiplexes to show, one need a new generation receiver or <a href="https://www.tbsdtv.com/">TBS DVB-S Card</a> is recommended.<br>

<a href="https://www.tbsdtv.com/products" target="_blank"><img src="img/tbs5930_1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="300" border="0"></a>

Ci, softcam's or smart cards are not necessary because everything is broadcasting Free To Air.<br>
This may change for the T2-MI Multiplexes in the future.<br>

Receivers in use on my setup are:<br>

Dreambox 800se <a href="https://github.com/jack2015/openpli-dreambox-oe-core" target="_blank">OpenPLI 12.2</a><br>

## Electronic Program Guide XMLTV

TV Channels on Express AM8 are not broadcasting Electronic Program Guide Data.<br>
It is possible to import EPG data yourself in XMLTV format.<br>

The enigma2 based receivers are having the rytec plugin in their image feed for importing epg data.<br>

<img src="img/xmltv.jpg" alt="" width="694" height="498"><br>

DVB-S card software including Smartdvb can import XMLTV so that an epg guide can be seen for the TV channels of Express AM8.<br>
